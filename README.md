# Interface Arcade

In this project, you will model the design flow of implementing an interface.
Namely, you will implement the `TwoPlayerGame` interface by creating a
two-player game that follows the documentation as listed in the 
[javadocs for this assignment](https://friendsbaltcs.github.io/docs/ACS/InterfaceArcade/).

## Project

Your two-player game should follow all of the specifications perfectly as your game will
_not_ be permitted to include method calls to run your game as a stand-alone program.
Rather, the methods will be called by a "user" or "third-party developer" (me) attempting
to create an arcade of all of your games. Everyone's program will be tested with the
_identical_ tester method (which you are not permitted to see ahead of time).

Still, it is a good idea to test your code yourself. Your project will be run for the first
time in front of the whole class, after which I will loudly announce your grade on the spot.
Good luck!
